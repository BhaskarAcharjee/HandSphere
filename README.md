# HandSphere - Hand Cricket Game

HandSphere is a Python-based interactive hand cricket game that allows you to play the popular game of hand cricket against a computer bot. Put your batting and bowling skills to the test and see if you can outscore the bot!

## Features

- <b>Toss:</b> The game starts with a toss to determine who bats first. You can choose either "Heads" or "Tails" to make your selection.
- <b>Batting and Bowling:</b> Once the toss is complete, you can choose to bat or bowl based on the toss result. Select the appropriate option to proceed.
- <b>Batting Shots (Advanced Version):</b> In the advanced version of HandSphere, you have the option to play different batting shots such as "Defensive Shot," "Attacking Shot," and "Lofted Shot." Each shot has different potential runs associated with it, making the game more exciting.
- Bowling Variations (Advanced Version):</b> In the advanced version, you can also choose from various bowling variations like "Fast Bowling," "Spin Bowling," and "Swing Bowling." Each variation has different potential runs associated with it, making the game more challenging.
- <b>Scoring:</b> The game keeps track of your runs, wickets, and the bot's guess. The scorecard is displayed in real-time, allowing you to monitor your progress during the game.
- <b>Innings:</b> The game is played in two innings. The first inning is your batting innings, and the second inning is your bowling innings. After each inning, you can view the scorecard and proceed to the next inning if required.
- <b>Target Score:</b> In the second inning, a target score is set based on the runs scored in the first inning. Your goal is to chase down the target within the specified number of overs.
- <b>Game Over:</b> The game concludes when all wickets are down or the specified number of overs are completed in the second inning. At the end of the game, the final scorecard is displayed, and the winner is announced.
