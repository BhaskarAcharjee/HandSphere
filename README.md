# HandSphere - Hand Gesture Game

HandSphere is a Python-based hand gesture game that combines two classic games, Hand Cricket and Rock Paper Scissors, into a single interactive experience. The game leverages hand gestures and user input to create an engaging and challenging gameplay environment.

## Game Description

The objective of HandSphere is to compete against the computer in a series of hand gesture matches. The game consists of two main components: Hand Cricket and Rock Paper Scissors.

### Hand Cricket

Hand Cricket is a classic game where players use hand gestures to represent cricket scores. The computer randomly selects a number from 1 to 6, and the player also selects a number using their hand gesture. If the player's number matches the computer's number, the player is out. Otherwise, the player's number is added to their score. The game continues until the player is out or chooses to end the inning.

### Rock Paper Scissors

Rock Paper Scissors is a popular hand gesture game where players choose between rock, paper, and scissors gestures to determine the winner. In HandSphere, the player competes against the computer in a series of rounds. The computer's hand gesture is randomly generated, and the player selects their hand gesture to challenge the computer. The winner of each round is determined based on the classic Rock Paper Scissors rules.

## Features
